						Just two good ol' boys Never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. Michael Knight a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent. The helpless. The powerless in a world of criminals who operate above the law. we might as well say... Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor. And we'll do it our way yes our way. Make all our dreams come true for me and you. We're gonna do it. On your mark get set and go now. Got a dream and we just know now we're gonna make our dream come true.
